### RUNNING IN LOCAL ENVIRONMENT

#### 1. Build

Build the project and run all unit tests:
```
mvn clean install
```

Build without unit tests:
```
mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
```

#### 2. Run

The project can be run as a Spring Boot app by using the main class - _**ScreenshotterApp.java**_.

To run the project **from the command line**, use the Maven command:
```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

#### 3. Use the app in a browser

To access the application open http://localhost:8083/screenshotter/screenshots/. A JSON representation of several screenshots will be shown.
    
To see a screenshot with id 1, call the http://localhost:8083/screenshotter/screenshots/1 URL.

To create a screenshot of the Apple.com webpage, use an application that can send HTTP requests, for example, Postman.
Send a POST request containing "http://apple.com" as plain text in the body. 

#### 4. Use the app via CLI
